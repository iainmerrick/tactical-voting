Questions, comments and contributions welcome!<hr><div id="what"><h3>What is tactical voting?</h3><p>It just means: <b>don't split the vote</b>.<p>Many of the 650 seats in UK elections have results like this:<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 6em">Party<th style="width: 3em; text-align: right">%<th style="width: 15em">Vote share<th><tr><td>Party A<td style="text-align:right">40%<td><div style="background-color: #e69f00; width: 40%; height: 1.5em"></div><td><tr><td>Party B<td style="text-align:right">30%<td><div style="background-color: #56b4e9; width: 30%; height: 1.5em"></div><td><tr><td>Party C<td style="text-align:right">25%<td><div style="background-color: #009e73; width: 25%; height: 1.5em"></div><td><tr><td>Others<td style="text-align:right">5%<td><div style="background-color: #f0e442; width: 5%; height: 1.5em"></div><td></table></div><p>Party A wins the seat outright despite having only 40% of the popular vote.<p>If parties B and C are closely aligned, this is a bad result for both of them: even though they have 55% of the vote between them, they both lose. To win the seat, those voters need to vote for a single party.<p>This is important: <b>tactical voting is not clever or complicated</b>.<p>All the local supporters of B and C must agree which of the two parties they'll get behind. There can't be any secret strategies or special plans. If they argue over which is best placed to defeat their common enemy, they'll split the vote and they'll probably both lose. The decision must be based on hard facts.<p>Here's a good straightforward approach:<ul><li>Decide which parties you wouldn't mind winning;<li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies">Check how your constituency voted</a> in the last election;<li>Vote for the one that got the most votes.</ul><p>This isn't very fair, but it's effective.<p>Finally: <b>tactical voting can have a huge impact</b>.<p>Most people know the UK's "first past the post" (FPTP) system isn't ideal, but I think many don't realise just how <em>strange</em> the results can be, and how damaging it is to split the vote. Dozens or even hundreds of seats could be in play, as the case studies below will show.<p>Tactical voting usually means switching your vote from a small party to a big one. But <b>both parties can gain seats</b> even if one party loses votes overall. FPTP rewards concentrated local support, and punishes widespread low-level support.<hr><div id="2010ge"><h3>2010 general election</h3><p>In 2010, there was a 3-way vote split between the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, resulting in a hung parliament. After almost a week of negotiations, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government.<canvas class="seats" width="250" height="100"></canvas><p><table class="results table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 4em">Party<th style="width: 2.5em; text-align: right">%<th>Vote share<th style="width: 9em">Tactical voting</table><p>Due to FPTP, the Conservatives and Labour got the lion's share of the seats. The Greens won a single seat (Brighton Pavilion) due to concentrated local support, but the Liberal Democrats and UKIP were under-represented.<p>To explore the effect tactical voting could have had, select two or more parties in the table above. Supporters of those parties will vote tactically: in each constituency, they'll support the strongest party in the group.</div><hr><div id="2015ge"><h3>2015 general election</h3><p>In 2015, the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed; the SNP, Greens and especially UKIP saw big increases. The Conservatives won a surprise majority, while the SNP swept Scotland.</p><canvas class="seats" width="250" height="100"></canvas><p><table class="results table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 4em">Party<th style="width: 2.5em; text-align: right">%<th>Vote share<th style="width: 9em">Tactical voting</table><p>Due to FPTP, the Conservatives gained 24 seats with only a 0.8% vote increase (smaller than that of UKIP, the SNP or Greens). Labour <em>lost</em> 26 seats despite a 1.5% vote increase. Apart from the SNP, other parties were under-represented, particularly UKIP (12.6% of the vote but only a single seat).</div><hr><div id="2017ge"><h3>What could happen in 2017?</h3><p>Here's the latest polling average (Sunday, May 8) from <a href="http://britainelects.com">Britain Elects</a>:<table class="poll table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 4em">Party<th style="width: 9.5em; text-align: center">%<th>Voting intention</table><p>We'll use a very simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_national_swing">uniform national swing</a> model to combine this with the 2015 results. <em>This is not a prediction, it's for illustrative purposes only.</em> For a real forecast, try <a href="http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html">Electoral Calculus</a>.</p><canvas class="seats" width="250" height="100"></canvas><p><table class="results table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 4em">Party<th style="width: 2.5em; text-align: right">%<th>Vote share<th style="width: 9em">Tactical voting</table></div><footer class="small"><p xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:vcard="http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#"><a class="icon" rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"><img src="https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png" style="border-style: none" alt="CC0"> </a>To the extent possible under law, <a rel="dct:publisher" href="https://keybase.io/iainmerrick"><span property="dct:title">Iain Merrick</span></a> has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to <a href="https://iainmerrick.github.io/tactical-voting/"><span property="dct:title">Tactical Voting in UK Elections</span></a>.
