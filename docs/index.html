After almost a week of negotiations, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government.<canvas class="seats" width="300" height="100"></canvas><p><table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed"><tr><th style="width: 4em">Party<th style="width: 2.5em; text-align: right">%<th>Vote share<th style="width: 9em">Tactical voting</table></div><p>Due to FPTP, the Conservatives and Labour got the lion's share of the seats. The Greens won a single seat (Brighton Pavilion) due to concentrated local support, but the Liberal Democrats and UKIP were under-represented.<p>To explore the effect tactical voting could have had, select two or more parties in the table above. Supporters of those parties will vote tactically: in each constituency, they'll support the strongest party in the group.<h2>2015 general election</h2><div id="election2015"><p>In 2015, the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed; the SNP, Greens and especially UKIP saw big increases.
